# E-commerce Conversion and Value Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting the **purchaseValue** of website visitors based on their click and impression data. This project was developed as part of a Kaggle competition.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze raw e-commerce data and build a predictive model to forecast the monetary value of user conversions. The process involved a full data science workflow, from data cleaning to model deployment.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Conducted in-depth analysis on raw click and impression data to uncover patterns and relationships that were used to inform feature engineering.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Engineered key features from the raw data to capture user engagement metrics and improve the model's predictive power.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Built and trained a machine learning model using XGBoost to accurately predict the `purchaseValue` of each visitor.

## Technical Skills and Tools

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (for the project notebook)
